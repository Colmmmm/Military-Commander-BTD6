# Military-Commander-BTD6
Adds a new custom tower to btd6, the Military Commander tower!
The military commander has 3 paths (5,5,5), + a Paragon!
Still work in progress, so if you have any ideas or you want your OWN custom tower, dm me on discord "Colmmmm#7597"

Credits: \n
          Bennik06- i used his code for making the base tower, and using his mods i could figure out alot about making my own mods.
          DoomBubbles- his "Card monkey" mod and "industrial farmer" helped me out a TON when making the mod.
          Everybody in 1330 studio's discord server, they helped me with even the simple stuff that i was too brain dead to realise.

TO-DO: (if you know how to do any of these things or wanna help me do it, please feel free to do me on discord "Colmmmm#7597")
          Make paragon ability damage stack with the degree. \n
          Make middle path and paragon buff other military monkeys in range. \n
          Maybe add carpet bomb ability from ace paragon to the paragon (i know how to add ability, just not fully how to setup the buttoms to set its drop location D: ) \n
